This project is to read json data from a file and convert
it to some java object or data structure and then again use that newly 
created object to convert it back to json data and write that
json data to file.

Java does not provide inbuilt library to parse json data so, I have
used third partly library called Gson (open source java library by Google)
to serialize and deserialize Java objects to JSON. I have added the 
necessary dependency to project in a form of jar file.
